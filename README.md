# AssemblyCode
Minesweeper Game
Project for CSC 210 - Assembler Programming with Professor Michael Vulis at the City College of New York.

About The Project
Use assembly language 16-bit tasm to create minesweeper.
Run the application using DOSbox.
Additional Information
Mine.ASM is the asm file with the minesweeper code in it.
Typing tasm Mine.ASM creates the .OBJ and .MAP file.
After getting the .OBJ file, type tlink Mine.OBJ to get the .exe file.
Run the Mine.exe file by typing Mine.exe. If it fails, close DOSBox and open it again and run Mine.exe again. It should work again.
Play the game by moving the arrow keys and spacebar to select.
When moving the cursor, make sure not to move it to a location where a number is already shown.
